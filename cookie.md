## **What are cookies?**

Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer or device used to access a website. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site.

## **What are the different types of cookies?**

1. first-party cookies which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (i.e. set by us); or
